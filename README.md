# Contact Management Application ðŸ’» ðŸ“‹ ðŸ’¡

This is a contact management application developed as part of a technical test for a Front-End position. The application allows importing, storing, editing, and deleting contacts using a Node.js server with Express and a PostgreSQL database on the backend, and a React Native client-side user interface on the frontend.

## Key Features

- Import Contacts: The application allows importing contacts from an external source, such as a CSV file or an API.

- Store in Database: The imported contacts are stored in a PostgreSQL database for persistence.

- Get Contacts: Contacts stored in the database can be retrieved and displayed in the user interface.

- Edit Contacts: Existing contacts can be edited to update the stored information.

- Delete Contacts: Contacts can be deleted from the database.

- Order Alphabetically: Contacts can be sorted alphabetically by name, last name, or email for easier navigation.

- Search Contacts: A search bar is available to search for contacts based on name, last name, or email.
